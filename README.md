# SquareEyesCA-HTML-CSS
Course assignment autumn - 2023

This project was a component of my coursework during the initial semester of Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, following the HTML and CSS course. Its design is rooted in the one I created as part of my coursework at the conclusion of the Design course in the same semester.
Process:

I commenced the project by meticulously analyzing each page and devising a structured approach for its layout. Ultimately, I employed a combination of nested grids and flex elements within grids, as I discovered that they greatly facilitated the creation of a responsive website. Additionally, I ensured that each image had alt text for improved accessibility, and I strived to make the links as transparent and user-friendly as possible.
Features
I used netlify to deploy:

Reflection:
While we have gained significant knowledge through both classroom instruction and self-study, integrating this information into practical coding proved to be a challenging endeavor. The abundance of different approaches to achieving the same result initially felt overwhelming, especially within the first two pages of the task.
